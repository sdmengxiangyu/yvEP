<p>
Greetings from <font color="lime"><b><i>yvbbrjdr</i></b></font>, the creator of yvEC. 
Hope you'd enjoy using this software. 
<p>
This software is aimed at providing safe IM service. 
And by using libsodium the safety can be guaranteed. 
<p>
Click a user on the right to start a chat. 
The Broadcast channel is a public channel where everyone will receive the message you send. 
<p>
Cloak can make you invisible to others, even when you are broadcasting. 
<p>
When yvEC failed to deliver the message, you can try Server Forwarding. 
<font color="red">However, it is very dangerous because a modified server could capture and see your messages. </font>
<p>
You can change the message tone by replacing "notification.wav".
